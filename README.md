# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my daily solved problems on Data Structures & Algorithms, organized by topic (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.). Each solution includes clean code and brief explanations to help track my progress and improve problem-solving skills over time.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in algorithms through consistent practice, learning patterns, and improving with real code examples. 

Topics covered include:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- And more!

Feel free to explore my solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning journey!
